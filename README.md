# Library_Book_Management_System_using-python

In this project, a Library Book Management System will be implemented with the front end GUI developed using Tkinter and the backend database implemented in SQLite. It is a single window tkinter GUI application which will implement CRUD( create, read, update, delete) operations on a ‘books’ database, in SQLite.
The window will contain text widgets to accept/ display book title, author, year of publication, ISBN (optional) and a large text area/ list box to display the records which match the search criteria. It should contain buttons to perform the following operations on the ‘books’ database:

display all the records

search a book

add a book

issue a book

delete a book

exit the application

When option 1 is selected, all the books present in the library should be displayed. Option 2 should be able to search the book based on any of the criteria like author name, book title, year or ISBN. Similarly, it should be able to add the entry when option 3 is selected and issue a book when option 4 is selected. The book details should be deleted when option 5 is selected. Selecting option 6 should provide a graceful exit from the app.
